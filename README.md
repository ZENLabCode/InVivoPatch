# InVivoPatch - Analysis Pipeline for Sleep State-Dependent Cortical Dynamics

This repository contains the complete analysis pipeline and code for processing in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from cortical neurons across sleep-wake states in mice.

## Overview

The codebase provides tools for:
- Processing and analyzing intracellular membrane potential recordings synchronized with EEG/EMG sleep scoring
- Extracting subthreshold membrane dynamics including depolarization events, cumulative activity, and state transitions

## Key Features

- **Electrophysiology Analysis**: Automated spike detection, membrane potential characterization, and UP/DOWN state segmentation
- **Sleep Scoring Integration**: Synchronization of neural recordings with vigilance state classification (Wake, NREM, REM)

## Data Availability
Code is written in MATLAB and compatible with standard electrophysiology file formats (ABF files from pClamp).
